# Javify
A simple program introducing java basics (Getters, Setters, Contructors, object instantiation)
In this program you will create a simple user class and generate, contructor, getters and setters automatically with an editor of your choice otherwise you can do it manually to get the basics right. Finally use it in your main program by instantiating the class.
